They all share a vision: robots are powerful tools to learn and be creative, and they collaborate to improve the project.\nThey develop new robotic behaviors, create pedagogical contents, design artistic performances, improve software or even create new robots.\nThe Poppy community develops robotic creations that are easy to build, customize, and use.\nWe promote open-source by sharing hardware and software. A web platform is associated enabling the community to share experiences and to contribute to its improvement.\nTo ease these exchanges two supports are available:\n\nThe poppy-project forum for help, discussions and sharing ideas.\nGitHub to submit your contributions.\n\nAll sources of the Poppy Project (software and hardware) are available on GitHub.\nThe Poppy project has been originally designed at Inria Flowers.\nThe Poppy creatures\nPoppy creatures are open-source robots, available for download and modification (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike for the hardware and GPLv3 for the software). They were all designed with the same principles in mind.\nAll Poppy creatures:\n\nare made from pieces of printable 3D and Dynamixel motors,\nuse an embedded board for control (a Raspberry Pi or Odroid for older versions),\nare based on a Python library, pypot, allowing to control Dynamixel servomotors in an easy way,\nhave a simulated version available (based on  CoppeliaSim),\ncan be controlled using a visual programming language (Snap! a variation of Scratch) and a textual language Python. They are also programmable through a REST API, which enables the control with other programming language,\ncome with associated documentation, tutorials, examples, pedagogical activities.\n\nThey can be used as it is, or hacked to explore new shapes, add sensors, etc...\nTo get your own Poppy robot, you can either:\n\nGet all the parts yourself by following the bill of materials (see below).\nBuy a full Poppy robotic kit from our official retailer, Generation Robots.\n\nPoppy Ergo Jr\nThe Poppy Ergo Jr robot is a small and low cost 6-degrees-of-freedom robot arm. It is made of 6 cheap motors (XL-320 Dynamixel servos) with simple 3D-printed parts.\n\nThe 3D parts were made so they can be easily printed on a basic 3D printer. The motors are only 20€ each. Its electronic card access is simple. It makes it easy to connect extra sensors and is well suited for pedagogical purposes.\nYou can choose among three tools at the end of its arm:\n\nA lamp.\nA gripper.\nA pen holder.\n\nThe rivets used make it easy and quick to change the tools. You can adapt it depending on the type of activities you are doing.\n\nThe Ergo Poppy Jr is ideal to start manipulating robots and learn robotic without difficulties. It is simple to assemble, easy to control and low price.\nYou can get all the parts yourself following the bill of materials (BOM) and print the 3D parts available in the STL format.\nFor more information, check the assembly guide of the Ergo Jr.\nPoppy Humanoid\nIt is a 25-degrees of freedom humanoid robot with a fully actuated vertebral column. It is used for education, research (walk, human-robot interaction) or art (dance, performances). From a single arm to the complete humanoid, this platform is actively used in labs, engineering schools, FabLabs, and artistic projects.\nYou can get all the parts yourself following the bill of materials (BOM) and print the 3D parts available as STL, STEP and Solidworks 2014 format.\n\nPoppy Torso\nIt is the upper part of Poppy Humanoid (13 degrees of freedom).\nPoppy Torso is thus more affordable than the complete Poppy Humanoid.\nIt makes it a more suitable solution for educational, associative and makers contexts.\nPoppy Torso can be a good medium to learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).\nYou can get all the parts yourself following the bill of material. The 3D models for the parts are the same as Poppy Humanoid, without the legs and with an extra suction cup support.\n\nOther interesting Poppy Creatures\nA key aspect of the Poppy Project is to stimulate creativity and experimentation around robotics.\nWe try to provide all the tools needed to design new robots based on the same technological bricks.\nSome new creatures are in development within the community.\nSome of them are presented in the section below.\nPoppy right arm (work in progress)\nPoppy right arm is a Poppy creature based on a right arm of Poppy Humanoid, with 3 additional XL-320 motors at the end to improve the reach and agility of the arm.\nIt used the same gripper tool used in the Ergo Jr, designed to grab simple objects.\n\nThe project was realized during an internship at Inria Flowers by Joel Ortiz Sosa. Find more info and the sources in the repository.\nSmall and low-cost humanoids\nHeol\nHeol - meaning \"sun\" in Breton - is a 34cm tall humanoid robot made by the association Heol robotics. 23 motors compose it, all other parts are 3D printed. It also uses the pypot library for its movements.\nHeol's purpose is to put a smile on ill children's faces. It can be an educational tool by becoming a learning support materials for programming and mechanical design.\nIts participation in the RoboCup (World Cup football for robot) is also envisaged.\n\nPoppyrate\nIt a robot based on Poppy Humanoid.\nIt aims at developing a more affordable version thanks to its smaller size and the use of cheaper motors.\nThe size reduction also makes it easier to print the parts on a standard 3D-printer.\nGoals also involved making it as mobile and customizable as possible while maintaining compatibility with Poppy software.\nPoppyrate will be sold as a kit (with and without the 3D parts) It has been designed by the society ZeCloud.\n\nFor more information, check their Twitter - Facebook!\nQuestions ?\nWe're always happy to help with code or other questions you might have!

For simplicity purpose, this computer can be remotely access through a web interface. It makes it easy to control the robot from your own computer or tablet without having to download/install anything.\nThere are two ways to setup the board for your Poppy robot:\n\nthe easy way: use a pre-made ISO image of the Poppy operating system and write it to an the SD-card\nthe hard way for advanced users: install everything from scratch\n\n\nNote If you are planning to use a simulated robot, you must install the software on your personal computer. Follow the instructions for setting up the simulation.\n\nEasy and recommended way: use the Poppy SD-card\nThe easiest and quickest way - by far - is to use an already made system image for a SD-card. ISO images come with everything pre-installed for your Poppy robot. It is also a good way to ensure that you are using exactly the same software as we are. Thus, you will avoid most problems.\n\nNote Poppy robotic kits come with a ready to use SD-card. So, you do not have anything special to do.\n\nThe images can be found in the release of each creatures:\n\nfor the Poppy ErgoJr\nfor the Poppy Torso\nfor the Poppy Humanoid\n\nThey can be written to a SD-card (at least 8 Go) by using classical utility tools.\nOnce the SD-card is ready, just insert it into the board. Then when you switch on your robot it should automatically start and you should be able to connect to its web interface.\n\nInfo More details can be found in the startup section.\n\nAdvanced way: DIY, install everything from scratch\nThe advanced way mainly consists in installing everything needed from scratch. This follows the same procedure as we use to generate the image for SD-cards. We mention this possibilty here as it can be useful if:\n\nYou are working with a simulated robot and thus have to manually install all the required software on your computer, this procedure could be a good place to see how this can be done on a Raspberry-Pi and adapted to another computer,\nyou want to customize the environment,\nor simply if you like to understand how it works.\n\n\nCaution We try to keep this installation procedure as generic as possible. Yet, some details may vary depending on your operating system or your computer. Moreover, the installation from scratch required some good knowledge of how to install and setup a python environment.\n\nDepending on what you want to do all steps are not necessary required. In particular, if you want to control a simulated robot, you may just want to install the python libraries for Poppy.\n\nInfo More details can be found in the Installation for advanced users section.\n\nSetup the network via Ethernet or Wifi\nOnce your Poppy is assembled and its software is ready, the next step is to connect it to a network. The goal is to let you remotely access the robot from your computer or smartphone/tablet, control and program it.\nThey are 4 methods to connect your robot to your computer/tablet/smartphone:\n\nConnect your computer to the Wifi network Poppy-Hotspot with password poppyproject (easiest method, but does not allow to connect to Internet)\nConnect your robot to your existing Wifi network (e.g. the router from your ISP at home, your school's Wifi network...). However this method requires to use another method first to open the settings interface and provide the Wifi name and password to your robot. \nConnect both the robot and the computer to a DHCP-capable router with the provided RJ45 (Ethernet) cable (most routers are DHCP-capable, but in some situation, access control could reject your robot)\nDirectly connect your robot to your computer with the provided RJ45 cable (handy method in some situations, but often tricky because it requires advanced network configuration according to your Operating system and installed software)\n\nOnce you're connected with any of these methods, to find the address of your robot on the network, we use the standard Zeroconf protocol. It allows you to use the robot hostname: \"poppy.local\" as its address. This should works without any configuration under Mac OS and GNU/Linux. But it required to install Bonjour Print Services on Windows.\nYou could also use the robot's IP address but this information is not easy to find if you're not familiar with computer networks.\nTo check that everything is setup correctly, you can go to the following url using your favorite web browser: http://poppy.local/. You can replace poppy.local by the IP address of your robot (something similar as http://192.168.0.42).\n\nCaution If you are not familiar with network configuration or have no idea what the previous paragraph explained, you should see with the IT network engineer, how this can be done.\n\nUse the web interface\nThe web interface is the central point to control, program and configure your robot. It can be used to:\n\nMonitor and Control the robot\nProgram it in Snap!\nProgram it in Python\nConfigure the robot (change its name, enable/disable the camera, update)\nReset and shutdown the robot\n\nTo access this interface, you simply have to go to the URL using your favorite web browser:\n\nhttp://poppy.local (if you changed the name of your robot, simply replace poppy by its new name)\nor using directly its IP address\n\nYou should see something like:\n\nThe buttons can be used to navigate to the different features. For instance, if you click on the Monitor and Control, you will access the monitor web app:\n\nThis let you turn on/off the motors of your robot, monitor them, and start/stop behaviors.\nThe What happened button is where you should look for more information is something goes wrong. Here is a screenshot of what you should see if everything goes well:\n\nQuestions ?\nWe're always happy to help with code or other questions you might have! You can ask questions and share solutions on our community Forum.\n\n"},"getting-started/program-the-robot.html":{"url":"getting-started/program-the-robot.html","title":"Program the robot","keywords":"","body":"Program the robot\nPoppy robots are designed to be easily programmed. They are three main options presented here:\n\nusing Snap!, a variant of Scratch the visual programming language,\nusing Python and leveraging the power of the whole API,\nthrough the REST API which let you  interface Poppy robots with other devices or any programming language.\n\n\nInfo Info: As for the rest of the project, all our software libraries are open source (GPLv3 License) and available on GitHub.\n\nUsing Snap!\n\nSnap! is a visual programming language - a variant of the very famous Scratch language. It is a block based drag-and-drop programming language that allows for a thorough introduction of IT. It runs in your browser as it is implemented in JavaScript. You do not need to install anything to start using it. It is open sourced and actively maintained.\n\nWe developed a set of custom blocks for Poppy robots that let you send motor commands and read values from the sensors of your robot. This let you to directly jump into controlling and programming your robot without any syntax/compilation issue. Thanks to Snap! live interaction loop you simply have to click on a block to send its associated command to the robot. Snap! also naturally scales to more complex projects.\nA dedicated chapter will guide you in what you can do with Snap! and Poppy robots.\nUsing Python\n\n\n\n\nPoppy libraries have been written in Python, to allow for fast development and extensibility and to benefit from all existing scientific libraries. Python is also a well-known language and widely used in education or artistic fields. By programming Poppy in Python, you will have access from the very low-level API to the higher levels.\nThe API has been designed to allow for very fast prototyping. Creating a robot and starting to move motors should not take more than a few lines:\nfrom pypot.creatures import PoppyErgoJr\n\njr = PoppyErgoJr()\njr.m3.goal_position = 30\n\n\nWe are also big fan of the Jupyter Project and notebooks. Notebooks are documents which contain both Python code and rich text elements like equations, pictures, videos. They can be edited from the Jupyter Web interface which allow users to program Poppy robots directly from a website hosted on the robot computer. We think that this is a powerful tool permitting the creation and sharing of live code, results visualizations and explanatory text combined in a single document.\n\nMost of the tutorials, experiments or pedagogical activities that we and the community develop are available as notebooks.\n\n\nInfo An updated gallery of notebooks can be found here. Contributions welcomed!\n\nThrough the REST API\nOn top of the Snap! and Python options, we wanted to provide another way of accessing and controlling your robot from any device or language. Poppy robots are providing a REST API. The most important features of the robot can be access through HTTP GET/POST requests.\nFrom a more practical point of view, this allows you to:\n\nWrite bridges to control Poppy robot in any language (awesome contributors have already written Matlab and Ruby wrappers).\nDesign web apps connected to your robot, such as the monitor interface (also a contribution!).\nMake your robot interact with other connected devices such as a smartphone, intelligent sensors, or even your twitter account...\n\n\nWarning The REST API is still a work in progress, will change and is clearly ill documented!

If you want to simulate other creatures, you should use CoppeliaSim. Support for the other robots is planned but not expected in the near future.\n\nWe think simulation can be a powerful tool. It allows the development and test of programs without the need of having a real robot. This is especially useful:\n\nTo discover and try the robot possibilities without having to spend real money.\nIn a context where multiple users share a robot. For instance in a classroom where each group can work using the simulator and validate their program on a real robot.\nTo design and run complex and time consuming experiments.\n\nWe try to make the switch from a simulated Poppy robot to the real one as transparent and as simple as possible.\nMost of the programming documentation is actually valid for both simulated and real robots.\nThe chapter From simulation to real robot will guide you in the few steps to transform your program running in simulation to one working with a real robot.\n\nWarning If you want to use Poppy robots using a simulator you will have to install some of the poppy libraries locally on your computer.\n\nInstall the needed software\n\nInfo Info: A full section is dedicated on how to install everything locally for using a simulator if you need more details.\n\nWhile the physical robots come with an embedded computer pre-installed, you need to install some software libraries on your computer to control simulated Poppy creatures.\nYou will also not have access to the robot web interface.\nYou will have to manually launch the different services to start programming your robot (the Jupyter server for Python notebooks, or the Snap! server).\nTo start controlling a simulated Poppy robots, either using CoppeliaSim or the web visualizer, you will need:\n\nPython >= 3.5\nThe Python library pypot\nThe Python library corresponding to your creature (e.g. poppy-ergo-jr)\n\nUsing CoppeliaSim (Formerly named V-REP)\n CoppeliaSim is a well known and powerful robot simulator. It is widely used for research and educational purposes. Moreover, it is available for free under an educational license. It can be download from this website (works under Mac OS, Windows and GNU/Linux).\n\nWarning It is important to note that as CoppeliaSim is simulating the whole physics and rendering of the robot, it may be slow if you do not have a powerful computer (especially the GPU card).\n\n\nAll main Poppy robots are available in CoppeliaSim:\n\nPoppy Humanoid\nPoppy Torso\nPoppy Ergo Jr\n\nV-REP can be used to learn how to control motors, get information from sensors but also to interact with the simulated environment.\nIt can be controlled using Python, Snap! or through the REST API.\nHere, are some examples of what the community has already been doing with it:\n\nA pedagogical activity to discover the different motor of your robot and how they can be controlled.\nA scientific experiment, where a Poppy Torso is learning how to push a cube on a table in front of it\n\n\n\nNote Even if we try, to reproduce the robot behavior and functioning, some differences remain. In particular, if you make a robot walk in simulation that does not necessarily mean that it will walk in the real world (and vice-versa).\n\nTo start the simulated robot, first open CoppeliaSim and instantiate you robot with simulator='vrep' argument.

Various and interdisciplinary robotic creations have emerged. Some of them are illustrated below.\nSchool of Moon\nThe School of moon play has been created by the contemporary dance company Shonen lead by the choreographer Eric Minh Cuong Castaing.\nThe stage is shared by children, two dancers (Gaëtan Brun Picard and Ana Pi), 3 Nao robots and two Poppy Humanoid robots. This play is a metaphor of the creation of a post-humanity in three acts: the Man, the Man and the machine, and the machine.\n\n\nThe representations are localized, meaning that the children dancing come from the local town. They also are specific sequences depending on the robots existing in the city.\nThe artistic challenges are:\n\nDirecting children on stage\nHaving interaction between humans and robots on stage\nHaving robots on stage\n\nThe creation was focused on 4 time periods:\n\n2 weeks of residence in September  2015 in CDC of Toulouse (France)\n2 weeks of residence in KLAP of Marseille (France) in December 2015\n4 weeks of residence in Ballet National de Marseille (France) in January 2016\n2 weeks of residence in Düsseldorf (Germany)\n\nCherry Project\n\nThe Cherry project is a community project to develop scenarios regarding breaking isolation of children at the hospital.\n This project uses Poppy robot as a companion for hospitalized children in primary school. Cherry can compensate a social rupture during hospitalization. It mediates between the child, his friends, his family and teachers and can talk to him or play some games.\n It also acts on a pedagogical level, to encourage the child to interact with the school, by offering quizzes and educational games.\n One last prospect is to assist the hospital staff in the therapeutic education. Indeed, sometimes a message is more acceptable by the child if it is issued by the robot rather than an adult dressed as a physician.\n \n \n \n\nMore information:\n\nThe facebook page\nThe twitter\nThe wordpress\nThe github (with a short wiki)\n\nConnect Poppy and Arduino thanks to Snap4Arduino\nGilles, teacher and maker at night, has developed many projects based on the Poppy Ergo Jr and Arduino. For connecting both worlds, it uses Snap4arduino. Then, it becomes really easy and elegant to make them communicate. You can simply mix Arduino with Poppy blocks and tadam you can control your robot with any Arduino based sensor.\n\n\n\nThen the only limitation is your creativity!

Electronics assembly\nBefore building any part of the robot, we will first plug electronics and connect the robot to the computer. The reason for this early connection is that you will need the robot software during the assembly: it allows to configure the motors.\n2.1. Insert the microSD card in the Raspberry Pi\nIf you bought a kit, Poppy software is preloaded on your SD card. If it not the case, you have to \"burn\" your micro-SD card with the ergo-jr ISO image, this is described in this section.\nThen insert the micro-SD card inside the Raspberry Pi: push the micro-SD in the connector slot.\n\n2.2. Mount the Pixl board\nThe Pixl board has 2 roles:\n\nPower the whole robot from the AC adapter (or from a battery but no battery holder is included in the kit)\nCommunicate with XL-320 motors via the Raspberry Pi computer\n\nCarefully insert the pixl at the end of Raspberry Pi headers:\n\nUse the standoff and the provided screw to fasten the Pixl board strongly to the Raspberry Pi. If it remains loose, it may cause your robot to reboot with bad timing.\nBefore going further, double-check that the Pixl board:\n\nIs connected to all the very last 10 pins of the Raspberry Pi (make sure you do not connect only 5 pins)\nIs directed at the interior of the Raspberry Pi board\nIs mounted exactly as in the image below\n\n\n2.3. Warnings\nPlease read them carefully to protect your equipment from damages.\n\nCaution  Disconnect power supply before (un)monting the Pixl this board is not meant to be hot-plugged, there is a risk of damaging it. \nNever use multiple power supplies at the same time: when the AC power is connected, do not try to power the Raspberry Pi from other sources such as via a micro-USB cable or a battery pack, you would damage it!\nYour Pixl must be strongly fastened: At first use, you may think inserting the Pixl into the 10 pins of the Raspberry Pi is enough to fix it ; however in the long run a loose Pixl will cause your robot to reboot during its manipulation: make sure to use the standoff and the screw to attach it harder.  \n\n2.4. First power up!\nThen, plug a motor cable (one of those provided in the motor's bag) by leaving the other side of this cable empty for now. And ultimately, connect the AC adapter to the wall socket.\n\nThen pay attention to the 2 LEDs of the Raspberry Pi:\n\nthe red LED (PWR = power) must stays on ; which means the board receives power. If it doesn't, check all connections, especially the way you mounted the Pixl board\nthe green LED (ACT = activity) must flicker for about 45 seconds, it means that the board is booting. if it isn't, check that the SD card is properly loaded with a valid image, or retry another burn\n\nIf you could see the green ACT led flickering for about 45 sec when plugging the robot, go on with your motor configuration...\n>> Next step: configure your motors\nQuestions ?\nWe're always happy to help with code or other questions you might have!

Motor configuration\nErgo Jr is made of 6 XL-320 motors from Robotis. Each of this servomotor embeds an electronic board allowing it to receive different kind of commands (position, speed or torque) and to communicate with other servos. Therefore, you can chain up several of these servomotors and command them all from one end of the chain: each servomotor will pass the orders to the next one.\n\nYet, in order for the motors to be connected and identified on the same bus, they must have an unique identifier (i.e. an unique name). Out of the factory they all set to the same identifier. In this section, we will give you details on how you can set a new and unique ID to each of your motors.\nWe recommend to configure motors in parallel of the mechanical assembly. Meaning that you shouldn't configure all motors right now: just read this page carefully and make some configuration attempts to get your hand in configuring motors, but you will actually configure all motors during the next step (the mechanical assembly). Note that a motor can be reconfigured as many times as necessary.\n3.1. Prepare the configuration\nIf you use Windows (not needed on GNU/Linux or Mac OSX) you first need to install Bonjour/Zeroconf (download link for Windows) or avahi to be able to connect to the robot.\nLook at Bonjour/Zeroconf protocol dedicated page for more details.\nTurn on the robot, with or without connected motors:\n\nplug the Ethernet cable (RJ45) from the robot to your Internet router \nplug the DC power on the pixl board\n\nNote: Although it is possible to connect the Ethernet cable directly from the robot to your computer, this method requires additional network configuration with Zeroconf so we do not recommend it \nYour robot boots up... check that the green LED ACT of the Raspberry Pi flickers during about 45 seconds. If it doesn't, then your SD card might be missing or faulty.\n3.2. Configuring motors one at a time (nominal case for robots acquired after October 2020)\nFrom your computer, you can now open a web browser (Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, Edge, ...) and load the following URL in the address bar: http://poppy.local.\nThe robot's first page should load. If it does not and shows an error like below, check that you did not miss the http:// prefix, and check that Bonjour is installed if you are running Windows. With GNU/Linux, it might be necessary to enable the \"local link only\" mode in your Ethernet settings. Otherwise your network might be misconfigured: try with another router or try a direct connection of the robot to your computer.\n\nMotor configuration is an individual process, it means that during the configuration of a motor, only this motor must be connected to the Pixl board. By configuring a motor, you will name it m1, m2, m3, m4, m5 or m6 by following this naming convention:\n\nIn order to configure a motor, you will have to connect only the following elements:\n\nthe Raspberry Pi\nthe Pixl board with its DC power supply\nOnly 1 motor cable coming from the Pixl board to the unique motor to be configured\nthe Ethernet cable connecting your Raspberry Pi to the network\n\nAt first boot, an assistant guides you for the initial configuration of the robot. Follow the proposed steps until you reach step 2: motor configuration:\n\nNote: If your robot does not show the initial configuration steps but brings you directly to the robot homepage, you might be using a former robot software version. In that case the assistant is not available, use the 3.2.bis. section below instead to configure your motors.\nLet's try to configure a motor now: Connect a single motor to the Pixl board, pick up some motor name in the list (say m5) and click the Configure button. You will see a log telling what's going on. If no error happened, the last log line must be Done!. Otherwise, the error explanation might help you find the issue.\nEvery time a motor is correctly configured, it is moved to its zero angle position, so if you see it moving it's generally a good news ; but if it does not move, it might be already in its zero position. You will need to disconnect the motor cable if you want to move again the motor wheel by hand.\nRecall that you shouldn't proceed with the configuration of all motors right now. But if you did, no worries, motors can be configured an unlimited number of times so you will be able to overwrite the configuration during the mechanical construction...\n>> Next step: mechanical construction\n3.2.bis. Configuring motors one at a time (for robots acquired before October 2020)\nBefore October, 2020, the Ergo Jr had no assistant at first boot but the robot directly showed the welcome page. In that case the motor configuration needs to be achieved with Poppy Configure:\nOpen a terminal\nFirst, open the welcome page at http://poppy.local, select Python, terminal or Programming, Python and then click on New, terminal as shown below:\n\nThe terminal is the black area that you see, in which you can type commands and visualize their output:\n\nConfigure a motor\nTo configure a motor with Poppy Configure, type the command poppy-configure ergo-jr  in which you replace the motor name by the corresponding one from m1 to m6. Check that no error happens when the command is over and that the last line is Done!.\n\n>> Next step: mechanical construction\n3.2.ter. Configuring motors one at a time (if you are using the ROS image)\nIf you don't know what ROS (Robot Operating System) is, this option is presumably not the one you're looking for. The ROS image for Poppy Ergo Jr does not embed the regular http://poppy.local graphical user interface. In order to configure the motors we will connect through SSH and use the Poppy Configure tool.\nOpen a terminal through SSH\nFrom a Linux or MacOS workstation, open a temrinal and type ssh poppy@poppy.local:\n\nYou will be first asked to confirm the connection by answering yes\nYou will then have to type the default password raspberry\nYour shell prompt must now display poppy@poppy instead of your regular prompt, which confirm that connection to the robot was successful via SSH\n\nNote:  If you meet this error: ssh: Could not resolve hostname poppy.local: Name or service not known, it means that you have a network issue.\nConfigure a motor\nTo configure a motor with Poppy Configure, type in the SSH terminal the command poppy-configure ergo-jr  in which you replace the motor name by the corresponding one from m1 to m6.

Mechanical Assembly\n4.1. General advices and warnings\n\nAll orientations of all parts are very important. Observe the pictures very carefully in order to reproduce the exact same assembly with the parts in the same orientation. If you make a mistake, you will realize it because your robot will perform motions different from what you'll ask. In that case do not worry, you will be able to unmount an remount your robot.\n\nYou can pre-assembly all riverts you need before building your robot. Rivets are composed of 2 elements inserted into each other this way:\n\n\n\n\nThere are two kinds of rivets. The grey ones and the others. Grey rivets are longer to be able to be inserted in the motor axis, at the opposite side of the horn (black revolving circle).\n\n\n\nUse the OLLO Tool for putting and removing rivets easily.\n\n\n\nDo not forget to put wires between motors while building the robot! Each motor, except the last, must have two wires; one connected to the previous motor and the other to the next (there is no importance on the connector choice).\n\n\nAlways make sure the zero angle mark is facing the top of the motor before assembling it! Otherwise your Poppy Ergo Jr will look all weird.\n\n\n\nEvery motor horns (motor wheels) are facing the left side of the robot:\n\n\n4.2. Step-By-Step guide\nStep 1 - motor 1\nFirst, configure one XL-320 motor as \"m1\".\nMount the motor on the 3D printed base.\n\nTo do so, prepare 8 small rivets. put the first part in the second part without putting them in the motor. Then, place the motor in the base, with the horn facing up and near the more open side.\nUse the Ollo to grab a rivet between the first and the second part, then put the rivet in one the assembly holes. Once the rivet is in place, lock it by pushing the part 1 of the rivet in part 2.\nStep 2 - motor 2\nConfigure the second motor, its name is \"m2\".\nMount the long_U part. Be careful with the orientation of the U, the horn must be oriented in the left.\nMount the motor \"m2\" on top of the construction.\n\nStep 3 - motor 3\nConfigure a third motor: \"m3\".\nMount horn2horn and horn2side parts on motor \"m2\", and mount \"m3\" on top of the construction.\n\nStep 4 - motor 4\nConfigure the fourth motor: \"m4\".\nMount the short_U on it.\n\nMount motor \"m4\" and the assembled short_U on top of the previous assembly. The nose of the motor should be on the other side of the base.\n\nStep 5 - motor 5\nConfigure the fifth motor: \"m5\".\nMount horn2horn and horn2side parts on motor \"m4\", and mount \"m5\" on top of the construction.\n\nStep 6 - the tool of your choice\nConfigure the sixth motor: \"m6\".\nTo finish your Ergo Jr, you need to add a tool at its end. Choose which tool you prefer among the lampshade, the pen holder or the gripper and follow the appropriate instructions below.\n\nNote Tools they can be easily and quickly changed, so you can adapt it to the different activities.\n\nStep 6 Option 1: Lampshade or pen holder\nMount horn2horn and horn2side parts on motor \"m5\", and mount \"m6\" on top of the construction.\n\nYou can mount the pen holder or the lampshade on the motor \"m6\".\n\nIn the same way you mount the lampshade, you can also mount the pen holder.\n\nStep 6 Option 2: Gripper\nMount the gripper-fixation between motors \"m5\" and \"m6\".\nMount gripper-fixed_part and gripper-rotative_part on motor \"m6\".\nThere is two way to mount the gripper, vertically\n\nOr Horizontally\n\nStep 7 - electronics\nMount the support_camera part on the base. Fix the Raspberry Pi camera on it and move the camera flex cable between motor \"m1\" and the base.\n\nCamera flex wire\nTo fix the flex cable of the camera on the Raspberry Pi:\n\nopen the camera connector by pulling on the tab to the top\nmake sure that connectors on the flex cable are facing away of the Ethernet port\npush the flex on the port, and push the plastic tab down to close it\n\n\nMotors wires:\nYou can now plug every motor wire by chaining them together from a motor to the next one. Every motor has two connectors, and it does not matter which of the 2 connectors you use.\nCheck that:\n\nthe first motor m1 is linked to both the Pixl and the second motor m2;\nthe last motor m6 is linked only to the previous motor m5, \nall other motors are linked to both the previous motor and the next motor.\n\n\nStep 8 - fix you Ergo Jr to the wooden disk support\nMount your Ergo Jr to the wood disk-support.\nMount the Raspberry Pi to the disk support, and use 4 x M2.5x6mm screw to fix it.\n\nStep 9 - wake up and test your robot!\nCongratulations, you achieved the robot assembly! Now, we can go on with the software assistant at step 3 : Wake up and test your robot.\nIt is first needed to Start Robot API: The API (Application Programming Interface) allows various software (e.g. some Python program, some Snap script, the Poppy monitor user interface... or any other software) to talk with the robot. Just click the blue button to start it and check in the log below that no error happens. \n\nClick on the START DANCE button. If your robot is dancing congratulations, you're done with the assembly!\nFeel free to discover the whole robot software on your own. In particular, have a look at these important elements:\n\nThe logs: they record all events happening on your robot.

It is your role to assemble it on the axis. The active horn has to be assembled by respecting precisely the alignment thanks to the marking as in the pictures below. \nWith MX-28 and MX-28AT motors, the horn is assembled by forcing on it. Hence, if you make a mistake, you will not be able to come back. Be sure of the alignement before forcing with the central screw.\n\n\nPRIMORDIAL warning #2: Don't use too much thread locker\nThread locker is included in your kit. Place some thread locker at the tip of all screws to prevent vibrations from untying the screws. However, dipping the extremity of the screw on the thread locker is enough (a drop for each screw hole is too much). Otherwise disassembling your robot can be very hard or impossible! If you're unsure, don't use the thread locker in a first step, it will always be possible to put it later when you know your robot better.\nPRIMORIDAL warning #3: Align the horn with 3D-printed parts\nNotice that horns all have 3 dots and that the 3D-printed parts also have them close to motor axes. Generally, the opposite axis of the motor axis is a free wheel and 3D-printed parts do not have any point in that side ; except for symmetrical parts such as the legs, that have 3 points on both sides. According to the 3D printing technique, the 3 dots might not been easily visible. Some parts, such as the feet, only have 1 visible point because the parts are hollowed the other side.\nYou must align the horn with the 3D-printed parts by matching the 3 points as the picture below.\n\nWarning #4: All parts have an unique orientation\nIt is very easy to get trapped by inserting a motor or a part the wrong way. If you do not pay attention you might find that your assembly is correct because holes align well with pieces but they might be incorrect. Don't worry, except for the first and second primordial warnings, your robot can always be disassembled.\nIn order to minimize the risk of mistakes, compare scrupulously your sub-assembly with pictures and videos at each assembly step. These prominent visual elements should help:\n\nThe position of motor axis (active wheel) vs the position of the free wheel\nThe position of the motor's sticker\nThe position of the motor's electrical connector\nThe curvature of 3D-printed parts\n\nWarning #5: Your robot is sensitive to interferences\nIf you meet sporadic communication issues with motors such as DxlError or timeout, it is possible that interferences perturbate your robot. Here are fixes to attempt:\n\nChange the motor cables: Motor cables heat and their conductive properties are getting worse over time. A typical example is when you feel that the cable is more rigid than a brand new cable\nIt may be useful to cut the central wire of the cable directly connected to the USB2AX (and only that one). Indeed, it is known that it can create interferences and this wire (+12V) is unused at this location. \n\n\nNext >> 2.

Mounting Dynamixel horns\nThe Poppy Torso robot is mainly built with MX-28AT Dynamixel servomotors (MX-28T are the previous version and can be used without any problem). \nThe other servomotors are two AX-12A (or AX-18) which are smaller, used only for the head.\nEach Dynamixel servomotor embeds an electronic board allowing it to receive different kind of orders (about goal, torque...) and communicate with other Dynamixel servos. Therefore, you can chain up several Dynamixel servomotors (each with a different ID) and command them all from one end of the chain: each servomotor will pass the orders to the next one.\nParts used along with Dynamixel motors\nHere is a table of the parts needed to mount the horns of the motors.\n\n\n\nServomotor\nmain horn\nfree horn\nbig horn screw\nhorn screws\ncase screws\n\n\n\n\nAX12-A\nnone\nnone\nM3x10mm\nM2\nM2\n\n\nMX28\nHN07-N101\nHN07-I101\nM2.5x8mm\nM2x3mm\nM2.5x6mm\n\n\n\nYou will need an allen wrench of size 1.5mm for M2 screws, 2mm for M2.5 screws and 2.5mm for M3 screws. The longer M2 screws need a Phillips screwdriver.\nMounting and aligning the active horns\nDon't mount the horns now, you should do it all along the assembly when a motor is needed. This is only general information, not all motors need to be mounted the same way: with or without rear wheel, with or without nuts ; this will be indicated in the videos for each specific motor.\nWhen you receive your Dynamixel servomotors, the horns and their washers are not mounted. The latter are included in the same packaging if the servo is packaged alone or they are packaged separately for 6-pieces bulks.\nOn top of the active motor axis (the axis that is driven by the motor), you will mount the horn and the washer (the white washer for the MX-28). As you already read in the PRIMORDIAL warnings #1 and #3 be very careful about the horn alignement both with the active motor axis and the structural part (3D printed). Here are other views of what you need to achieve:\n\n\nThen you can force on the horn to insert it and use a screw (the longest model) with very few thread locker to fix it. But, again, this is definitive.\nIf you are unsure that you have well aligned the active horn\nIf you are unsure that you have well aligned the horn: Install Poppy software and invoke Poppy Configure with the name of a motor of the same model (MX28/MX-28AT) so that it goes to its zero angle.\nIf, after setting your motor to zero angle, the horn does not point upwards as in the image below, then you made a mistake in horn alignment.\n\n\nIf you made a mistake in the active horn alignment\nIf you assembled the horn and forced without aligning it correctly, you have two solutions:\n\nThe offset can be compensated from software in the configuration file of your creature, but this is an advanced operation and you first need to know how much the offset is\nYou can attempt to remove the horn. You will necessarily damage the motor, so be very cautious in order to minimize damages. Proceed as follows:\nUse a flat screwdriver with a tip of about 2mm in length\nRemove the center screw if any and carefully slip the tip under the horn\nApply a slight rotative pressure pressure on you screwdriver\nRotate the horn of 45° and apply another pressure there as shown on the picture\nPursue pressures evert 45° all around the horn by keeping your screwdriver always inserted at the same location in order to minimize damages of the black chassis and the washer\nWhen the horn is disengaged of about 2mm from the motor (you screwdriver is too narrow to force again), you should be able to pull the horn by hand by pulling very straight and shaking slightly\nRe-insert then the active horn properly\n\n\n\n\nParticular cases of horn alignment according to motor types\nHorns of motors AX-12 and AX-18 are also oriented but motors are shipped with the horn pre-assembled so there is no danger.\nThus, the assembly of motors MX-32 and MX-32AT are the most at risk.\nMounting the rear horn (free wheel)\nIn most cases, on the other side of the active/driven horn with the 3 dots, you will have to mount another horn with ball bearings.\nThere is no important alignement on this side, this is just a free wheel. Insert a long screw with very few thread locker. However check that this horn rotate very easily by hand, just as a free wheel would rotate when mounted on a ball bearing. A locked free wheel would prevent the motor from moving.\n\n\n\nInserting the nuts\nSome nuts will have to be inserted in the motors in order to receive the screws allowing the 3D printed parts to be fastened. The location needing nuts will be told in the videos for each motor.\nIn order to place a single nut: Take a nut using thin tweezers and bring it in the sitewith the right orientation. Put the end of the tweezers in the hole to ensure good alignment. Then use flat pincers to adjust the nut. These nuts correspond to diameter 2.5mm screws, Allen wrench 2mm.\nOlder motor version MX-28 have no thread at all, but newer version MX-28AT are partially threaded in a side. So less nuts will be needed with newest motors.\n\n\n\nLater on, when you tighen the screw, make attention not to push the nuts unintentionally. Once motors are inserted in some structural parts, som nut locations can no longer be reached by hands so you will not be along to insert the fallen nuts again. \nNext >> 4.

Configuring the Dynamixel motors\nEvery Dynamixel motor has its own configuration including:\n\nits digital identifier (e.g. id=21, this is the right hip motor)\nits baudrate: the speed of communication\nits return delay time:\n\nBy default all brand new motors have an id = 1 with default communication parameters, so all motors need to be configured one-by-one in order to be attributed their right parameters.\nNaming convention\nTo simplify the configuration, all Poppy motors are named (e.g. right_shoulder_x) as shown on the naming convention below. It means that given a motor name, software can deduce the right configuration parameters.\n\nConnect a single motor to configure it\nConfiguring a single motor requires 1x SMPS2Dynamixel (SMPS) adapter, 1x USB2AX adapter, 1x 12V power supply, and 2x Dynamixel cables.\nThe USB2AX USB adapter allows some computer (the Raspberry Pi or another computer) to communicate with the motors. The SMPS adapter injects power from the wall socket to the data bus, because such powerful motors cannot be powered from USB only.\nThey must be connected this way:\n\nThen plug the USB to your computer and the 12V power adapter to the wall socket.\n\nNote Removing the central wire of the cable connected to the USB2AX (and only this one) is optional. It is something advised to do it in case of interferences on the data bus\n\nInstall the driver for the USB2AX adapter\nOn Linux/MacOS\nOn Linux/MacOS, no installation is needed, but you must add yourself in the group which own the USB serial ports. It is \"dialout\" or \"uucp\" depending on your distribution:\nsudo addgroup $USER dialout\nsudo addgroup $USER uucp\nThen you need to logout from your session and login again.\nOn Windows\nInstructions for Windows ar available here.\nUse a software to configure the connected motor\nThere are 3 different software tools to configure your motors one-by-one:\n\nPoppy Configure: Command-line tool that only requires to provide the motor name\nHerborist: Graphical tool used in the videos in place of Poppy Configure\nDynamixel Wizard: windows-only tool provided by Robotis.\n\nYou can use whichever one as long as you manage to configure your motor, but we advise Poppy Configure:\nPoppy Configure\nPoppy Configure is a command-line tool to configure Poppy motors that is handy because it only requires the name of the motor to configure it.\nIt is pre-installed on the Raspberry Pi image, so you can plug a HDMI monitor and use it in a terminal, but you may also use another computer, as long as you first install Poppy software.\nOpen a terminal and type the command poppy-configure humanoid  in which you replace the motor name by the corresponding one.\n\nPoppy Configure will configure the motor with the right configuration and then move to zero (angle = 0 degree). We strongly advise you to make advantage of that to double-check that the horn is properly aligned with the motor axis: at 0 degree, the single dot must point upwards.\n\n\nNoteIf Poppy Configure displays such error message: poppy-configure: error: argument robot: invalid choice: 'humanoid', then you have missed the installation of the humanoid creature. Use command pip install poppy-humanoid to fix it.\n\nHerborist\nHerborist can be installed with pip once you have setup a Python environment in your computer:\npip install herborist\nThen, type this command to launch it:\nherborist\n\nConnect each motor one by one to the USB2AX and use the ’scan’ button in Herborist or Dynamixel Wizard to detect it. If it’s a new motor, it should have ID 1 and baudrate 57600bps, apart from AX-12A servos which already have a 1000000 baudrate.\nYou have to set:\n\nThe digital ID corresponding to the naming convention\nBaudrate to 1 000 000 bps\nReturn delay time to 0 ms instead of 0.5 ms\n\nIn Herborist, don’t forget to click on the ’Update EEPROM’ button so the changes are taken in account.\nWhen should I configure a motor?\nDon't make the configuration of all motors now, it is advised to configure a motor each time you mount it into the mechanical structure.\n\nNoteYou can setup the configuration of a motor as many times as needed. So there is no danger at making confugration attempts now to check that everything is alright\n\nNext : 5.

It is your role to assemble it on the axis. The active horn has to be assembled by respecting precisely the alignment thanks to the marking as in the pictures below. \nWith MX-28 and MX-28AT motors, the horn is assembled by forcing on it. Hence, if you make a mistake, you will not be able to come back. Be sure of the alignement before forcing with the central screw.\n\n\nPRIMORDIAL warning #2: Don't use too much thread locker\nThread locker is included in your kit. Place some thread locker at the tip of all screws to prevent vibrations from untying the screws. However, dipping the extremity of the screw on the thread locker is enough (a drop for each screw hole is too much). Otherwise disassembling your robot can be very hard or impossible! If you're unsure, don't use the thread locker in a first step, it will always be possible to put it later when you know your robot better.\nPRIMORIDAL warning #3: Align the horn with 3D-printed parts\nNotice that horns all have 3 dots and that the 3D-printed parts also have them close to motor axes. Generally, the opposite axis of the motor axis is a free wheel and 3D-printed parts do not have any point in that side ; except for symmetrical parts such as the legs, that have 3 points on both sides. According to the 3D printing technique, the 3 dots might not been easily visible. Some parts, such as the feet, only have 1 visible point because the parts are hollowed the other side.\nYou must align the horn with the 3D-printed parts by matching the 3 points as the picture below.\n\nWarning #4: All parts have an unique orientation\nIt is very easy to get trapped by inserting a motor or a part the wrong way. If you do not pay attention you might find that your assembly is correct because holes align well with pieces but they might be incorrect. Don't worry, except for the first and second primordial warnings, your robot can always be disassembled.\nIn order to minimize the risk of mistakes, compare scrupulously your sub-assembly with pictures and videos at each assembly step. These prominent visual elements should help:\n\nThe position of motor axis (active wheel) vs the position of the free wheel\nThe position of the motor's sticker\nThe position of the motor's electrical connector\nThe curvature of 3D-printed parts\n\nWarning #5: Your robot is sensitive to interferences\nIf you meet sporadic communication issues with motors such as DxlError or timeout, it is possible that interferences perturbate your robot. Here are fixes to attempt:\n\nChange the motor cables: Motor cables heat and their conductive properties are getting worse over time. A typical example is when you feel that the cable is more rigid than a brand new cable\nIt may be useful to cut the central wire of the cable directly connected to the USB2AX (and only that one). Indeed, it is known that it can create interferences and this wire (+12V) is unused at this location. \n\n\nNext >> 2.

Mounting Dynamixel horns\nThe Poppy Humanoid robot is mainly built with MX-28AT Dynamixel servomotors (MX-28T are the previous version and can be used without any problem). \nThe other servomotors are MX-64T which are bigger and stronger, and AX-12A or AX-18 which are smaller, used only for the head.\nEach Dynamixel servomotor embeds an electronic board allowing it to receive different kind of orders (about goal, torque...) and communicate with other Dynamixel servos. Therefore, you can chain up several Dynamixel servomotors (each with a different ID) and command them all from one end of the chain: each servomotor will pass the orders to the next one.\nParts used along with Dynamixel motors\nHere is a table of the parts needed to mount the horns of the motors.\n\n\n\nServomotor\nmain horn\nfree horn\nbig horn screw\nhorn screws\ncase screws\n\n\n\n\nAX12-A\nnone\nnone\nM3x10mm\nM2\nM2\n\n\nMX28\nHN07-N101\nHN07-I101\nM2.5x8mm\nM2x3mm\nM2.5x6mm\n\n\nMX64\nHN05-N102\nHN05-I101\nM3x8mm\nM2.5x4mm\nM2.5x6mm\n\n\n\nYou will need an allen wrench of size 1.5mm for M2 screws, 2mm for M2.5 screws and 2.5mm for M3 screws. The longer M2 screws need a Phillips screwdriver.\nMounting and aligning the active horns\nDon't mount the horns now, you should do it all along the assembly when a motor is needed. This is only general information, not all motors need to be mounted the same way: with or without rear wheel, with or without nuts ; this will be indicated in the videos for each specific motor.\nWhen you receive your Dynamixel servomotors, the horns and their washers are not mounted. The latter are included in the same packaging if the servo is packaged alone or they are packaged separately for 6-pieces bulks.\nOn top of the active motor axis (the axis that is driven by the motor), you will mount the horn and the washer (the white washer for the MX-28). As you already read in the PRIMORDIAL warnings #1 and #3 be very careful about the horn alignement both with the active motor axis and the structural part (3D printed). Here are other views of what you need to achieve:\n\n\nThen you can force on the horn to insert it and use a screw (the longest model) with very few thread locker to fix it. But, again, this is definitive.\nIf you are unsure that you have well aligned the active horn\nIf you are unsure that you have well aligned the horn: Install Poppy software and invoke Poppy Configure with the name of a motor of the same model (MX28/MX-28AT or MX-64) so that it goes to its zero angle.\nIf, after setting your motor to zero angle, the horn does not point upwards as in the image below, then you made a mistake in horn alignment.\n\n\nIf you made a mistake in the active horn alignment\nIf you assembled the horn and forced without aligning it correctly, you have two solutions:\n\nThe offset can be compensated from software in the configuration file of your creature, but this is an advanced operation and you first need to know how much the offset is\nYou can attempt to remove the horn. You will necessarily damage the motor, so be very cautious in order to minimize damages. Proceed as follows:\nUse a flat screwdriver with a tip of about 2mm in length\nRemove the center screw if any and carefully slip the tip under the horn\nApply a slight rotative pressure pressure on you screwdriver\nRotate the horn of 45° and apply another pressure there as shown on the picture\nPursue pressures evert 45° all around the horn by keeping your screwdriver always inserted at the same location in order to minimize damages of the black chassis and the washer\nWhen the horn is disengaged of about 2mm from the motor (you screwdriver is too narrow to force again), you should be able to pull the horn by hand by pulling very straight and shaking slightly\nRe-insert then the active horn properly\n\n\n\n\nParticular cases of horn alignment according to motor types\nHorns of motors AX-12 and AX-18 are also oriented but motors are shipped with the horn pre-assembled so there is no danger.\nHorns of motors MX-64 and MX-64AT are also oriented but horns can be removed easily with no damage to the motor.\nThus, the assembly of motors MX-32 and MX-32AT are the most at risk.\nMounting the rear horn (free wheel)\nIn most cases, on the other side of the active/driven horn with the 3 dots, you will have to mount another horn with ball bearings.\nThere is no important alignement on this side, this is just a free wheel. Insert a long screw with very few thread locker. However check that this horn rotate very easily by hand, just as a free wheel would rotate when mounted on a ball bearing. A locked free wheel would prevent the motor from moving.\n\n\n\nInserting the nuts\nSome nuts will have to be inserted in the motors in order to receive the screws allowing the 3D printed parts to be fastened. The location needing nuts will be told in the videos for each motor.\nIn order to place a single nut: Take a nut using thin tweezers and bring it in the sitewith the right orientation. Put the end of the tweezers in the hole to ensure good alignment. Then use flat pincers to adjust the nut. These nuts correspond to diameter 2.5mm screws, Allen wrench 2mm.\nOlder motor version MX-28 have no thread at all, but newer version MX-28AT are partially threaded in a side. So less nuts will be needed with newest motors.\n\n\n\nLater on, when you tighen the screw, make attention not to push the nuts unintentionally. Once motors are inserted in some structural parts, som nut locations can no longer be reached by hands so you will not be along to insert the fallen nuts again. \nNext >> 4.

Configuring the Dynamixel motors\nEvery Dynamixel motor has its own configuration including:\n\nits digital identifier (e.g. id=21, this is the right hip motor)\nits baudrate: the speed of communication\nits return delay time:\n\nBy default all brand new motors have an id = 1 with default communication parameters, so all motors need to be configured one-by-one in order to be attributed their right parameters.\nNaming convention\nTo simplify the configuration, all Poppy motors are named (e.g. right_hip_x) as shown on the naming convention below. It means that given a motor name, software can deduce the right configuration parameters.\n\nConnect a single motor to configure it\nConfiguring a single motor requires 1x SMPS2Dynamixel (SMPS) adapter, 1x USB2AX adapter, 1x 12V power supply, and 2x Dynamixel cables.\nThe USB2AX USB adapter allows some computer (the Raspberry Pi or another computer) to communicate with the motors. The SMPS adapter injects power from the wall socket to the data bus, because such powerful motors cannot be powered from USB only.\nThey must be connected this way:\n\nThen plug the USB to your computer and the 12V power adapter to the wall socket.\n\nNote Removing the central wire of the cable connected to the USB2AX (and only this one) is optional. It is something advised to do it in case of interferences on the data bus\n\nInstall the driver for the USB2AX adapter\nOn Linux/MacOS\nOn Linux/MacOS, no installation is needed, but you must add yourself in the group which own the USB serial ports. It is \"dialout\" or \"uucp\" depending on your distribution:\nsudo addgroup $USER dialout\nsudo addgroup $USER uucp\nThen you need to logout from your session and login again.\nOn Windows\nInstructions for Windows ar available here.\nUse a software to configure the connected motor\nThere are 3 different software tools to configure your motors one-by-one:\n\nPoppy Configure: Command-line tool that only requires to provide the motor name\nHerborist: Graphical tool used in the videos in place of Poppy Configure\nDynamixel Wizard: windows-only tool provided by Robotis.\n\nYou can use whichever one as long as you manage to configure your motor, but we advise Poppy Configure:\nPoppy Configure\nPoppy Configure is a command-line tool to configure Poppy motors that is handy because it only requires the name of the motor to configure it.\nIt is pre-installed on the Raspberry Pi image, so you can plug a HDMI monitor and use it in a terminal, but you may also use another computer, as long as you first install Poppy software.\nOpen a terminal\nIn order to use Poppy Configure you need a terminal:\n\nIf you installed Poppy software by yourself, you probably know how to locate your system terminal and open it\nIf your robot software was preinstalled, open the welcome page at http://poppy.local, select Python, terminal or Programming, Python and then click on New, terminal as shown below:\n\n\nYour terminal is the black area that you see, in which you can type commands and visualize their output:\n\nConfigure a motor\nTo configure a motor with Poppy Configure, type the command poppy-configure humanoid  in which you replace the motor name by the corresponding one. It will only work if either a Pixl board or a USB2AX adapter is connected to a motor (and only one).\n\nPoppy Configure will configure the motor with the right configuration and then move to zero (angle = 0 degree). We strongly advise you to make advantage of that to double-check that the horn is properly aligned with the motor axis: at 0 degree, the single dot must point upwards.\n\n\nNoteIf Poppy Configure displays such error message: poppy-configure: error: argument robot: invalid choice: 'humanoid', then you have missed the installation of the humanoid creature. Use command pip install poppy-humanoid to fix it.\n\nHerborist\nHerborist can be installed with pip once you have setup a Python environment in your computer:\npip install herborist\nThen, type this command to launch it:\nherborist\n\nConnect each motor one by one to the USB2AX and use the ’scan’ button in Herborist or Dynamixel Wizard to detect it. If it’s a new motor, it should have ID 1 and baudrate 57600bps, apart from AX-12A servos which already have a 1000000 baudrate.\nYou have to set:\n\nThe digital ID corresponding to the naming convention\nBaudrate to 1 000 000 bps\nReturn delay time to 0 ms instead of 0.5 ms\n\nIn Herborist, don’t forget to click on the ’Update EEPROM’ button so the changes are taken in account.\nWhen should I configure a motor?\nDon't make the configuration of all motors now, it is advised to configure a motor each time you mount it into the mechanical structure.\n\nNoteYou can setup the configuration of a motor as many times as needed. So there is no danger at making confugration attempts now to check that everything is alright\n\nNext : 5.

Poppy humanoid: wiring arrangement\n9.1. Data and power buses\nBefore you can startup your robot, let's have a look at the cables. You must connect wires from motors to motors by forming 2 different buses:\n\nUpper body (from head_y to abs_x)\nLower body (from r_hip_z and l_hip_z to r_ankle_y and l_ankle_y)\n\nThese 2 buses are fully disconnected from each other (1), they have their own:\n\nPower supply (SMPS2Dynamixel + wall socket)\nDynamixel hub to plug up to 6x motors\nUSB2AX\n\nThe drawing below shows the 2 data and power buses: cables connecting motors are in red, data hubs and SMPS power injection in green. \n\n(1) N.B.: If you own a single power supply unit, you may connect both power buses together by adding a 4-wire cable and cutting out its data bus so that only 1 SMPS2Dynamixel is powered, as shown in the video. But this is unnecessary in most cases since robots are sold with 2 power supply units.\nBoth USB2AX adapters have to be plugged to the USB sockets of the Raspi3 at the bottom of the head. If you mess up with wiring, at first startup, software will report missing motors or too much motors or the same bus.\n\n9.2. Power supplies for Poppy Humanoid\nThe robot requires 3 power supply cables:\n\n12V power supply for the SMPS2Dynamixel of the upper body\n12V power supply for the SMPS2Dynamixel of the lower body\n5V micro USB power supply for the Raspberry Pi 3\n\nFor now you can plug the 3 cables to the robot but wait a bit before connecting them to the wall socket.

Otherwise replace all poppy.local occurrences by the IP address of the robot given by your router.\n\nInstallation\nWindows\nYou have to install Bonjour print services for Windows (yes, it is an Apple software).\nIf you already have installed an Apple Software like iTunes or QuickTime, Bonjour should be installed.\n\nWarning Times to times, even if Bonjour is already installed on your computer you can't connect directly to your Ergo Jr. To solve the issue, un-install and re-install Bonjour.\n\nOn GNU/Linux based operating systems\nOn GNU/Linux, you have to install avahi-daemon (mDNS) and avahi-autoipd (IPv4LL), it may or may not be installed by default depending on your installation.\nOn Ubuntu/Debian, run\nsudo apt install avahi-daemon avahi-autoipd\n\nOn Fedora / CentOS, run\nsudo yum install avahi-daemon avahi-autoipd\n\nTo connect to your robot directly with an Ethernet wire, you need to select local link only on the IPv4 configuration of your Network manager.\nMac OSX\nBonjour is already installed with OSX. Moreover, if you plan to connect your computer directly to the robot (without a router), use a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter rather than a USB to Ethernet\nAdvanced information: What Zeroconf does for you\nLocal domain name (mDNS)\nZeroconf client publishes a decentralized local domain name (mDNS) with the '.local' top level domain. It means that you can join any local local computer by its hostname with the '.local' suffix instead of its IP address.\nWith a zeroconf client, to ping a computer called (hostname) 'ergojr', you can simply do:\n$ ping ergojr.local\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.42: icmp_seq=0 ttl=54 time=3.14 ms\n[...]\nYou no longer need to look for its IP address on your local network; you don't even need to understand what an IP address is.\nIt also work on your web browser. To open the website hosted on the robot computer called 'ergojr', you have to open: http://ergojr.local on your favorite web browser URL field.\nLink-local IPv4 addresses (IPv4LL)\nAmong other Zeroconf tools, there is an implementation of decentralized DHCP (IPv4LL), which allow computers obtain an IP and connect each others without a DHCP server.\nThe auto-adressed IP is in the APIPA range, from 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255.\nThis is why you may see thiese unusual IP addressses when connecting your robot to your computer. Whereas, in presence of a DHCP server, IP addresses of computers and robots are from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 or 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 or, more frequently, 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255. You might observe that, if you enable the internal hotspot of Poppy, addresses are from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255.\nThis way, it is possible to connect your robot directly to your computer with a single Ethernet cable because no intermediary device like a router or any DHCP server is needed to provide the IP addresses, they are self-assigned.\nAlternatives to find the IP address of a computer on your local network\nIf you cannot (or doesn't want to) install a zeroconf client on your personal computer, you can use one of the following methods to find the IP address of your robot.\n\nYou can use Fing, famous for its Android and iOS applications\nIf you are connected in Wifi through a smartphone via its accept point feature (Android or iOS), most access points display a list of connected clients as well as their associated IP address \nNmap or arp(only GNU/Linux and MAC OSX) if you are not afraid of command line interfaces.nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24\narp -an | grep -i B8:27:EB\n\nYou can also go to your router web interface (with its IP address on your web browser like http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1 or http://192.168.0.254 or http://192.168.1.254), you should have a section of connected hosts.\n\n\nQuestions ?\nWe're always happy to help with code or other questions you might have!

The image written to your card will be verified afterwards.\n\nIf there is no error, your SD card is ready. You can now assemble your robot!\n3. Option B: Burn the image with dd (CLI software, for advanced users)\n\nDanger This method works only for GNU/Linux and OSX operating systems, and is not recommended if you don't understand what you do.\n\nInsert the SD card and look for where your disk is mounted (/dev/mmcblk0 and /dev/disk2 for the following example). Adapt and execute one on these commands. Be careful, you could erase one of your primary disk partition if you don't understand what you do.\nIf you are on a GNU/Linux OS:\nsudo dd bs=1M status=progress if=poppy-ergojr.img of=/dev/mmcblk0\n\nIf you are running OSX or another BSD based OS:\nsudo dd bs=1M status=progress if=poppy-ergojr.img of=/dev/rdisk2\n\n\nRun sync; this will ensure the write cache is flushed and that it is safe to unmount your SD card.\n\nRemove the SD card from the card reader.\n\n\nIf there is no error, your SD card is ready.

This reboot is needed to proceed to the finalisation of the partition resizing. Now your board should install all the poppy environment. Please do not unpower the board or shut-it down.\nYou can see the installation process by reconnecting you to your board with your new poppy account: ssh poppy@poppy.local password=poppy.\nBecause of the compilation of heavy Python packages (Scipy, Numpy) it can take more than 1 hour to complete.\nA process will automatically take you terminal and print the installation output. You can leave it with ctrl+c. You can get back this print by reading the install_log file:\ntail -f install_log\nBe patient...\nAt the end of the installation, your board will reboot again. You can look at the log tail -f install_log, if everything ended well, last lines should be:\nSystem install complete!\nPlease share your experiences with the community : https://forum.poppy-project.org/\n\nNote: If you are not sure of what going up, you can see if the install process is running with: ps up $(pgrep -f 'poppy_launcher.sh')\n\nThe hostname, default user and password will be all set to \"poppy\" (ssh poppy@poppy.local password=poppy).\nYou can test your installation with the web interface in your web browser http://poppy.local.\nQuestions ?\nWe're always happy to help with code or other questions you might have!

We strongly recommend you to use Chromium Browser (which is very similar to Chrome without tracking tools), or Google Chrome.\n\nIntroduction to Snap! programming\nThis chapter will focus on things necessary to understand in Snap! for using Poppy creatures.\nIf you want a well designed online lesson on Snap! we strongly encourage you to look at the \"Beauty and Joy of Computing\" (BJC) course made by the University of Berkeley for New York high school students.\nSome of the snapshots and concepts of BJC have been used for writing this chapter.\nConnect your robot to Snap!\nIf you use a simulated robot on CoppeliaSim\n\nInfo You need to have installed Poppy software libraries and CoppeliaSim simulator on your computer.

You can use its IP address (for example http://192.168.1.42) if you have a way to know it or its hostname like http://poppy.local. To find its IP address look at the zeroconf chapter. To use directly its hostname http://poppy.local you must have a Zeroconf software installed on your computer (aka \"Bonjour print services for Windows\" if you are running Windows).\nThe home page of your poppy creature should look like the snapshot below:\n\nClick on the \"Start Snap!\" link to open the Snap! interface at start the connection with the Poppy robot.\nPoppy special blocks are stored in the Examples. Go to \"file\" icon -> open -> Examples -> click on \"Poppy blocks\". It may take some time to load the blocks (~5-15 seconds), be patient.\nInterface and general ideas\nSaving in Snap!\nThere are three ways of saving a project in Snap!\nSave the project in your web browser\n\nWhen you are not logged in Snap! Cloud, the default behaviour of Snap! is to save your project in your browser.\nTechnically this uses the Local Storage which is a memory space in your web browser where websites can store offline data. This is very convenient because you have not to register or to see Snap! project files, but keep in mind that these projects are only visible in this specific web browser in this specific computer.\nSnap! Cloud\n\n« There is no Cloud, it's just someone else's computer ».\n\nInstead of saving your projects on your web browser, you can save them in Snap! servers in UC Berkeley, called \"cloud\". Moreover, this allows you to share your project with anyone, with a simple link.\nCreate an account on Snap! cloud\nClick on the cloud button -> \"signup...\".\n\nFill the required fields in the modal window for signing up.\n\nYou will soon receive a validation email with a random password.\nYou can now log in with your username and password.\n\nIf you use your personal computer, remember to check the \"stay signed in on this computer [...]\" checkbox.\n\nAfter logging in account, you are free to change your password: click on the cloud button -> \"Change Password\".\n\nShare your Snap! project\nThe big advantage of using Snap! Cloud is the ability to share a copy of your project with anyone.\nTo share a Snap! project, you first need to be logged in Snap! Cloud and having your current project saved (\"save\" or \"save as\"). Go to the \"open\" menu:\n\nIn the cloud section, select the project you want to share and click on \"Share\" button.\n\nHere is the trick step: to see the share link, you have to click on the \"Open\" button.\n\nAnd this will re-open your project with the public sharing URL.\n\nYou can copy and paste the URL and share it by the way you want to your friends or to the Poppy community with the forum forum.poppy-project.org.\nWhen you open a share project, the project is automatically opened in full screen on the sprite zone. To quit the full screen you have to click on the double arrow at the top of the snapshot below.\n\nExport/Import your Snap! project\nIf you have a limited access to internet and you want to share project with other people, the best way is to export it:\n\nA new tab in your web browser will be opened with an XML file like the picture below.\n\nThis file describe all your Snap! project in a a simple file. It's not made to be human readable so don't be afraid, you just have to save it on your computer. For that, do a right click, chose \"save as\" and a proper name and location on you computer for this project.\nIf you want to import a previously exported project, you simply have to click on the import section of the file icon.\n\nSearch Poppy blocks\nEvery Poppy block in Snap! begins by a robot icon. So you can search all of them by the robot keyword. To search a specific block, do a right click on the block area, or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+F.\n\n\n\nNetwork\nFirst test your connection with the (tangible or simulated) robot with the \"test connection\" block.\n.\nif the block answer is \"You may have connection troubles\", your \"host\" variable inside the Snap! project is probably wrong. The host variable must be the IP or the hostname+\".local\" of your robot ; if you're using CoppeliaSim localhost is used to point to your own computer.\n.\nBuild your own blocks!\nThe functionality to build your own block was the first difference between Scratch and Snap! (now it's also possible to make custom blocks in Scratch)!\n\nDescription of Poppy blocks\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nThis block allows you to connect Snap! to your robot. The host input can accept : - robot_name.local (e.g. : poppy.local if your robot’s name is poppy)- the IP address (e.g. 123.124.145.176)\n\n\n\nClick on this block to verify that you are connected to your robot.\n\n\n\nPut one or many motors in compliant or stiff mode. Motors are hand-drivable in compliant mode but must be in stiff mode to controlled with Snap!.The “motor(s)” input can accept:- string of a motor name (e.g. m1)- string of many motors separated with spaces (e.g. m1 m2 m4)- a Snap! list of motors like the reporter block \"$robot all motors\"\" or the block “list”\"\n\n\n\nPut one or many motors in a position (angle in degree) in a given time.The “motor(s)” input can accept: - string of a motor name (e.g. m1) - string of many motors separated with spaces (e.g. m1 m2 m4) - a Snap! list of motors like the reporter block \"$robot all motors\"\" or the block “list”.  “Wait” can be true or false. If it’s on True, the action will wait the end of the previous action. If it’s on False, then the action will proceed during the previous one.\"\n\n\n\nRestart the software inside the robot.\n\n\n\nPut the value to one register (position, speed, max torque, …) of one or many motors.\n\n\n\nActivate/deactivate color leds of motors and choose the color of your choice.The “motor(s)” input can accept: - string of a motor name (e.g. m1) - string of many motors separated with spaces (e.g. m1 m2 m4) - a Snap! list of motors like the reporter block \"$robot all motors\"\" or the block “list”\n\n\n\nPlay a movement at a given speed. It is necessary to indicate the exact name of the movement previously recorded. This block can be nested in the “concurrent/sequential” block.\"\n\n\n\nAll blocks in input are run one after each other.You can use this block to play concurrently many sequently move.\n\n\n\nAll reports input are run simultaneously.You can use this block to play concurrently many recorded move.\n\n\n\nCreate and start a movement recorded by demonstration to the given motors.\n\n\n\nStop a record and save the recorded move in the robot.Be careful, you must have previously defined a move record with the \"create & start record move ...\"\" block.\n\n\n\nStop a movement that is being played.\n\n\n\nPlay movements at the same time (can be nested to concurrent block). Inputs can be : - move name (string) - any reporter block, like sequential or play sequentially\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay movements following in order (can be nested to sequential block). Inputs can be :  - move name (string) - any reporter block, like sequential or play sequentially\n\n\n\nStart/Stop/Pause/Resume an integrated behaviour of the robot. It can be a position, a movement, a sensorimotor loop, high level camera feature..\n\n\n\nPlay a move in reverse at a given speed  (reporter block)\n\n\n\nPlay a move at a given speed (command block)\n\n\n\nGive motors which are in a given group. You can know groups name with the block “all motors groups”.\n\n\n\nReturn a list with the name of every motors in the robot.\n\n\n\nGive the value of a register (position, speed, load, ... ) of one or many motors.\n\n\n\nGive the position of every motors. It is a shortcut to the block above. It is useful to make a snapshot of pose of the robot.\n\n\n\nReturn the index of a motor name in the \"all motors\" block list.\n\n\n\nGive the URL of the robot. For internal use only.\n\n\n\nGive all records stored in this robot.\n\n\n\nGive the list of all attached/running behaviours .\n\n\n\nGive all existing motors groups.\n\n\n\nGet all methods or functions which are runnable in a behavior.It is an advanced block.\n\n\n\nReturn a boolean (true/false) depending if the selected card is detected by the camera of the robot.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions ?\nWe're always happy to help with code or other questions you might have!

As it is actually the language used for writing Poppy core libraries, you will see how to access all the different levels of control, from the higher to the lower.\nWe will detail everything you need to know to directly program you robot using the Python embedded in the Poppy robot or to install everything locally. Note that this chapter does not intend to teach you Python or programming from scratch and thus if you are completely new to Python it may be good to start with a Python tutorial. Yet, we try to keep the tutorials as simple as possible and we will always warn you when some parts are targeting more advanced users.\nWe will try to provide as many examples as possible and point to the complete API so you can find and use the least famous features. Most of the examples and tutorials are available as a collection of Jupyter notebooks. The next chapter, Jupyter Notebooks Gallery, presents a list describing each notebook, what they will teach, what they can be used for, for which robot, etc.\nAll Poppy libraries are open source and are released under the GPL v3 license. So you can freely access the source code on github. Do not hesitate to fork them, send pull request and contribute!\nWhy Python?\n\nThe libraries developed for the Poppy project were designed with the aim to make it easy and fast to write code for controlling various robots based on - originally - robotis dynamixel motors. The idea was to provide access from the lower level - raw serial communication with a specific motor for instance - to higher levels such as starting and stopping primitives/behaviors (e.g. face tracking, postures, ...) or directly recording motions through learning by demonstration.\nWe decided to write most of them in Python as its flexibility allows for fast and modular development. It was also meant to be accessible by a large audience, from developers and roboticists in general, to hobbyists, researchers, artists... Python was also chosen for the tremendous pools of existing libraries (scientific, computer vision, IO, web...) so if one is interested in adding a new feature, such as support for a new motor/sensor, it should be as easy and fast as possible.\nFinally, support for multiplatforms and ease of installation were also key aspects.\nOverview of the different libraries\n\nInfo A more detailled documentation of these software libraries is available in the software libraries section\n\nBefore jumping into the code, we will briefly introduce the different existing Poppy libraries and how they interact with each other.\nThey are three main library levels:\n\npypot: This is the core of the Poppy software architecture. Pypot handles all the low level communication with the hardware (both sensors and motors), defines synchronization loops so your command are always up to date. It also provides the primitives mechanism which allows the definition of simple behavior that can be - more of less - automatically combined.\n\npoppy-creature: This library defines the common tools shared by all Poppy robots, for instance how to automatically launch the simulator or start the HTTP API attached to any robot.\n\npoppy-ergo-jr, poppy-torso, and poppy-humanoid: Those libraries are specific to their respective Poppy robot. They define the particular configuration of the robot, the sensors it uses, which motors are connected to which buses... This is also were behaviors specific to a creature are defined (the stand primitive for the humanoid for instance).\n\n\nThis is summarized in the diagram below:\n\nInstallation\nFirst, note that if you are only planning to use real robots, they already come with Python and all Poppy libraries installed. You can directly connect to the Jupyter notebook server via the web interface and have nothing to install on your machine!\nWhat you need to install is summarized in the diagram below:\n\nYet, if you are planning to either\n\nUse a simulator (e.g. CoppeliaSim, or web simulator),\nor want to directly plug the robot to your computer\n\nYou will have to install Poppy libraries locally. They work on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, and have been tested on Python >= 3.5. Python 2 and Anaconda recipes are no longer supported starting from pypot >= 4.0.\nAlso note that if you are planning to directly plug your robot to your USB port, specific drivers should be installed.\nAll steps are detailed in the chapter install Poppy software.\nQuickstart: Hello Poppy world!\nTo give you a rapid overview of what you can do using Python to program Poppy robots, this section will show you how to:\n\nCreate and connect your robot\nRetrieve values from the sensor and send motor commands\nStart playing with primitive by recording motions by demonstration\n\nThis section does not intend to cover everything that can be done in Python with Poppy but to give you sneak peaks of the most common features. For more advanced use, you should refer to the next section where we present a list of Jupyter notebooks each detailing a specific aspect or feature.\nIn the following examples, we assume that you have a working environment meaning that you either:\n\nare using the Python embedded in your robot: through the Jupyter Notebook server,\nor you have installed everything locally to work with a simulator.\n\nCreate and connect to a Poppy robot\nImport the library\nThe very first step you have to do to start programming Poppy robots in Python is to import the library. In Python they are called module or package.\nTo do that, you write something similar to:\nfrom pypot.creatures import *\n\nThis will actually import all Poppy robots installed on the Python distribution you are using. If you want to use a specific robot, you can replace the * (which means all here) by the name of the robot you want.\nFor the ErgoJr:\nfrom pypot.creatures import PoppyErgoJr\n\nFor the Torso:\nfrom pypot.creatures import PoppyTorso\n\nFor the Humanoid:\nfrom pypot.creatures import PoppyHumanoid\n\n\nNote If you see an error similar to the one below when executing the previous line, this means that the libraries are not correctly installed. See the section install Poppy software.\n\nIn [1]: from pypot.creatures import PoppyHumanoid\nImportError Traceback (most recent call last)\n in ()\n----> 1 from pypot.creatures import PoppyHumanoid\n\nImportError: cannot import name PoppyHumanoid\n\nCreate the Robot object - with a real robot\nThen, you can actually create the Python object that will represent your robot. Depending on the Poppy robot you are using:\n# if you are using an Ergo Jr\npoppy = PoppyErgoJr()\n\nor\n# if you are using a Torso\npoppy = PoppyTorso()\n\nor\n# if you are using a Humanoid\npoppy = PoppyHumanoid()\n\nAnd that's it, if you did not see any error message it means that you are connected to your robot. If you see an exception like the one shown below, you should check the wire connection and try again:\nIOError: Connection to the robot failed! No suitable port found for ids [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]. These ids are missing [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] !\n\nCreate the Robot object - with CoppeliaSim\nTo use a simulated robot instead of a real one, you only have to specify it when creating the Robot object. For instance, if you want to create a simulated Poppy Torso, you simply have to execute the following line:\npoppy = PoppyTorso(simulator='vrep')\n\nAll three Poppy robots - Humanoid, Torso, and Ergo Jr - can be used with CoppeliaSim.\nIf you see an error message like this, check that you have launched CoppeliaSim and that you have close the popup in CoppeliaSim (see this chapter for details).\nIOError: Connection to CoppeliaSim failed!\n\nCreate the Robot object - with web simulator\nCurrently only the Ergo Jr is usable within the web simulator.\nIt also requires specific versions of libraries to be used properly.\nTo make sure you meet these requirements, you can type this command from your shell:\npip install pypot>=2.12 poppy-creature>=1.8 poppy-ergo-jr>=1.6 --upgrade\n\nYou can then instantiate the poppy-ergo-jr creature:\npoppy-services --poppy-simu --snap --no-browser poppy-ergo-jr\n\nThis will create a server for Snap! on port 6969, and a server for the visualizer on port 8080.\nYou can then head to the visualizer page.\nAccess the sensors and motors\nThe robot object you just created contains two main groups of objects:\n\nmotors\nsensors\n\nthat can be easily access using poppy.motors and poppy.sensors. As soon as the robot object is created it automatically starts synchronization loops which will ensure that the last available value are received/sent to the robot.\n\nNote  Servomotors that are used in Poppy robots can be seen as both motors and sensors. Indeed, on top of being \"simple\" motors, they also provide multiple sensing information: their current position, speed and load but also their temperature, the current used... Yet, for simplification they are only available under the motor category.\n\nGet data from your robot\n\nNow that you have created your robot object, you can directly use Python to discover which motors are attached.\n\nNote In all examples below the results are shown for an ErgoJr. If you are using a Torso or a Humanoid you will see more motors with different names.\n\nFor instance, to know how many motors your robot have you can execute:\nprint(len(poppy.motors))\n\npoppy.motors is actually a list of all motors connected to your robot. Thus, if you want to get the present position of all motors, you can do:\nfor m in poppy.motors:\n    print(m.present_position)\n\nOf course, you can also access a specific motor. To do that, you need to know the name for the motor you want to access. You can find this list in the assembly documentation of your robot.\nYou can also get a list of all motors name directly from python:\nfor m in poppy.motors:\n    print(m.name)\n\nor using a motor pythonic expression:\nprint([m.name for m in poppy.motors])\n\nThen you can directly access the desired motor by its name:\nm = poppy.m3\n\nor get its position:\nprint(poppy.m3.present_position)\n\nThe most common values for motors are:\n\npresent_position\npresent_speed\npresent_load\n\nSimilarly, you can get data from your sensors. Depending on the Poppy robot you have different sensors available. You can get the list of all sensors in the exact same way you did for motors:\nprint([s.name for s in poppy.sensors])\n\nAnd then access a specific sensors by its name. For instance, to get an image from the camera of the Ergo Jr:\nimg = poppy.camera.frame\n\n\nNote This section just presented some of the available values that you can get from your motors/sensors. They are many other - some are specific to a particular robot - we will present them through the different notebooks.\n\nSend motor commands\nNow that we have shown you how to read values from your robot, it is time to learn how to make it move!\nThis is actually really similar to what you have just seen. Instead of getting the present_position of a motor you simply have to set its goal_position.\nBut first, you have to make sure your motor is stiff, meaning that you cannot move it by hand. To do that we will turn off its compliancy. Assuming you have an Ergo Jr and want to make the motor m3 moves - feel free to use any other motor but make sure the motor can freely move without hurting any of your finger:\npoppy.m3.compliant = False\n\nThe motor should now be stiff. And then, to make it move to its zero position:\npoppy.m3.goal_position = 0\n\n\nNote: present_position and goal_position are actually two different registers. The first refers to the current position of the motor (read only) while the second corresponds to the target position you want your robot to reach. Thus, they can have different values while the motor is still moving to reach its goal_position.\n\nAs a slightly more complex example we will make it go to 30 degrees then -30° three times:\nimport time\n\nfor _ in range(3):\n    poppy.m3.goal_position = 30\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    poppy.m3.goal_position = -30\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n\nNote that after each new value set to goal_position we wait so the motor has enough time to actually reach this new position. Another way to do the same thing is to use the goto_position method:\nimport time\n\nfor _ in range(3):\n    poppy.m3.goto_position(30, 0.5, wait=True)\n    poppy.m3.goto_position(-30, 0.5, wait=True)\n\nAs you can see, this method takes three arguments, the target position, the duration of the move and whether to wait or not the end of the motion.\nIf you want to move multiple motors at the same time, you can simply do something like:\nfor _ in range(3):\n    poppy.m1.goal_position = -20\n    poppy.m3.goal_position = 30\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    poppy.m1.goal_position = 20\n    poppy.m3.goal_position = -30\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n\nor use a python dictionary storing the target position per motor you want to move, that can be given to the goto_position method:\npos_1 = {'m1': -20, 'm3': 30}\npos_2 = {'m1': 20, 'm3': -30}\n\nfor _ in range(3):\n    poppy.goto_position(pos_1, 0.5, wait=True)\n    poppy.goto_position(pos_2, 0.5, wait=True)\n\n\nNote You can turn a motor back to its compliant mode (where you can freely move it) by setting its compliant register to True:\npoppy.m3.compliant = True\n\n\nRecord and play motion by demonstration using primitives\nPypot provides you with the primitive mechanism, which are simply pre-defined behaviors that can be attached to your robot. In this section, we will show you how to use some primitives already existing for recording and playing motions. You can also define your own primitive but this is out of the scope of this section, you will find details on how to do this in dedicated notebooks.\nRecord a motion by demonstration\nDesigning choreographies for your robot using goal_position or goto_position can be long and kind of troublesome. Fortunately, there is a much more efficient way of doing this: recording motions by directly demonstrating the move on the robot.\nThis can be summarized into few steps:\n\nmake the robot compliant so you can move it by hand\nstart the recording\nactually moves the robot so it follows whatever move/choreography you can think of\nstop the recording\n\nAnd now to do that in Python:\nSo, first we turn all motors of the robot compliants:\nfor m in poppy.motors:\n    m.compliant = True\n\n\nInfo You can also record a movement with motors stiff (compliant = False), and moving them with goal_position or goto_position commands.\n\nThen, we have to include the primitive used for recording motion:\nfrom pypot.primitive.move import MoveRecorder\n\nTo create this primitive, you have to give the following arguments:\n\non which robot you want to use this primitive (this can be useful if you are working with multiple robot at a time - for instance you can record a move on a robot and at the same time make it reproduce by another one.\nthe record frequency of the move you want to register: how many position per second will be recorded - the higher the more accurate the record will be but also more data will have to be processed - good values are usually between 10Hz and 50Hz.\nthe motors that you want to record. you can record a move on a subpart of you robot, for instance only on the left arm.\n\nHere, we will record a move on the whole robot at 50Hz:\nrecord = MoveRecorder(poppy, 50, poppy.motors)\n\n\nNote We used poppy.motors to specify that we want all motors if you only want let's say the two first motors of an Ergo Jr you could have used [poppy.m1, poppy.m2] instead.\n\nNow it is time to record. As it can be hard to both move the robot and type Python command at the same time, we will make a small script, that:\n\nwait 5s so you can get ready to record\nstart the record\nrecord for 10 seconds\nstop the records\n\nimport time\n\n# Give you time to get ready\nprint('Get ready to record a move...')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\n# Start the record\nrecord.start()\nprint('Now recording !')\n\n# Wait for 10s so you can record what you want\ntime.sleep(10)\n\n# Stop the record\nprint('The record is over!')\nrecord.stop()\n\nNow, you should have a move recorded. You can retrieve it from the recorder primitive:\nmy_recorded_move = record.move\n\nand check how many positions where recorded:\nprint(len(my_recorded_move.positions()))\n\nReplay recorded moves\nNow to play back recorded motions you have to use another primitive: MovePlayer\nfrom pypot.primitive.move import MovePlayer\n\nplayer = MovePlayer(poppy, my_recorded_move)\n\nAs you can see, to create it you have to specify the robot (as for the MoveRecorder) and the move you want to play.\n\nNote Automatically all recorded motors become stiff to be able to play the move.\n\nThen, you can simply start the replay:\nplayer.start()\n\nAnd if you want to play it three times in a row:\nfor _ in range(3):\n    player.start()\n    player.wait_to_stop()\n\nWe use the wait_to_stop method to make sure we wait for the first move to finish before we start another. By default, playing a move we will not block to allow you to play multiple move in parallel.\nWrite a simple sensori-motor loop\nRobotic is all about sensori-motor loops, meaning that motor commands will be more or less directly related to the sensor readings. In other terms the robot actions will be determined by what it perceives from its environment.\nPoppy libraries and more particularly pypot provides you with tools to easily write sensori-motor loops. We will show here a very simple example where some motor of an Ergo Jr will be controlled by the position of other motors in order to keep the head of the Ergo Jr straight.\nTo do that, we will free the two first motors, so they can be moved by hand. Two other motors will try to lively compensate the motion applied on the free motors.\nWe need few simple steps:\n\nread values from sensors (here the two free motors)\ncompute command from those readings\nset new motor command\ngo back to step 1.\n\n\nNote This example is designed for the Ergo Jr. It could be adapted to other Poppy robots, by changing the motors used. Yet, it is not that obvious which one to use to have a \"cool\" result.\n\nDemo version\nBefore writing the sensori-motor loop, we will first set the Ergo Jr in a base position.\nfrom pypot.creatures import PoppyErgoJr\n\njr = PoppyErgoJr()\n\njr.goto_position({'m1': 0.,\n                  'm2': -60.,\n                  'm3': 55.,\n                  'm4': 0.,\n                  'm5': -55.,\n                  'm6': 60.}, 2., wait=True)\n\nThen, we make sure the moving speed of the motors are not too high to prevent shaky motions:\nfor m in jr.motors:\n    m.moving_speed = 250\n\nFinally, we free the two first motors:\njr.m1.compliant = True\njr.m2.compliant = True\n\nNow, that everything is setup we write our very simple sensori-motor loop like this:\nimport time\n\nwhile True:\n    # Step 1\n    p1 = jr.m1.present_position\n    p2 = jr.m2.present_position\n\n    # Step 2\n    g1 = -p1\n    g2 = -p2\n\n    # Step 3\n    jr.m4.goal_position = g1\n    jr.m6.goal_position = g2\n\n    time.sleep(.02)\n\n\nStep 1: As you can see, here our readings step is simply to retrieve the present_position of the motors m1 and m2.\nStep 2: Here, we defined the base position so the motors m1/m4 and m2/m6 are parallel. Thus, to compensate the head position, we simply have to define the new motor goal position as the opposite of the read present position.\nStep 3: We simply set the goal position as the just computed command\n\nThose steps are included inside an infinite loop - with a time.sleep to avoid CPU overhead.\n\nNote To stop this while True loop, you will have to use the classical Ctrl-c, or use the stop button if you are running it through Jupyter.\n\nNow with a primitive\nBut what about if you want to make this behavior an independent \"brick\" that you can start/stop on demand combine with other behaviors. Well, primitives are meant to do just that.\nThere is two main types of primitive: Primitive and LoopPrimitive. The first one basically gives you access to just a run method where you can do everything you want on a robot. The second one as the name indicates is an infinite loop which calls an update method at a pre-defined frequency. In our case it is the more suited one.\nHere is the entire definition of this primitive:\nclass KeepYourHeadStraight(LoopPrimitive):\n    def setup(self):\n        for m in self.robot.motors:\n            m.compliant = False\n\n        self.robot.goto_position({'m1': 0.,\n                                  'm2': -60.,\n                                  'm3': 55.,\n                                  'm4': 0.,\n                                  'm5': -55.,\n                                  'm6': 60.}, 2., wait=True)\n\n        for m in self.robot.motors:\n            m.moving_speed = 250\n\n        self.robot.m1.compliant = True\n        self.robot.m2.compliant = True\n\n    def update(self):\n        self.robot.m4.goal_position = -self.robot.m1.present_position\n        self.robot.m6.goal_position = -self.robot.m2.present_position\n\nAs you can see, there is two main parts. The setup method which defines what needs to be done to prepare the robot before starting the behavior - here simply puts it in its base position and turn on the compliance for the two first motors.\nAnd the update method which will be regularly called: here is where we put the actual code for the sensori-motor loop: reading sensor - computing the new command - and sending the new command to the motors.\nNow that we have defined our primitive, we can instantiate it and start it:\n# we specify we want the primitive to apply on the jr robot instance\n# and that the update method should be called at 50Hz\nhead_straight = KeepYourHeadStraight(jr, 50.0)\n\nhead_straight.start()\n\nYou can stop it whenever you want:\nhead_straight.stop()\n\nAnd re-starting it again...\nhead_straight.start()\n\nThe huge advantage of using a primitive in this case is that after starting it, you can still easily run any other codes that you want. The primitive starts its own thread and thus runs in background without blocking the execution of the rest of the code.\nQuestions ?\nWe're always happy to help with code or other questions you might have!

When working with a real robot you can program it from a web browser on your own machine but your notebooks are actually stored and run in the robot.\nThus to switch from simulation to a real robot, you need to switch from your local instance of Jupyter to the remote one hosted by the robot. The steps are described below.\nConnect to the Jupyter on the robot\nOnce connected to the robot web interface http://poppy.local (we will assume here its hostname is poppy, just replace it by the new hostname if you changed it), you should see a open Ipython notebook link.\n\nWhen clicked it will start Jupyter on the robot and redirect you to the Jupyter webserver. You should then see the root of the notebook folder hosted on the robot:\n\nThis is where you can put your own notebooks. Of course, you can create folder, organize them as you want, etc...\nNote: If you need finer access or more advanced configuration (such as permission for instance), you have to log directly to the robot using ssh.\nUpload a notebook\nOnce connected to the Jupyter server hosted by the robot, you can directly use the Jupyter interface for uploading new notebooks.\n\nThe circled button let you upload your local notebook, so stored on your own machine, to the robot. They can then be directly run on the robot.\nBe aware that at the moment, we do not deal with sessions or permissions (as JupyterHub does for instance), and thus anyone with access to the robot can use or delete all notebooks stored in the robot.\nAdapt your code\nThere is few places where you should actually modify your code so it works with a real robot. We try to minimize the effort needed as much as possible, yet some steps are still required.\nInstantiation\nWhen creating the robot, you actually need to specify if you are willing to work with a real or a simulated robot. This is simply done via a parameter. For instance:\nWhen working with CoppeliaSim:\nfrom pypot.creatures import PoppyHumanoid\n\npoppy = PoppyHumanoid(simulator='vrep')\n\nWill become for a real robot:\nfrom pypot.creatures import PoppyHumanoid\n\npoppy = PoppyHumanoid()\n\nOf course, this works for all existing Poppy creatures: Humanoid, Torso and ErgoJr.\nThis is most of the changes that you should do.\nSpecific APIs\nSome part of the API are platform specific. For instance, when using CoppeliaSim you have access to tracking features that let you retrieve any object 3D position. Of course, such method do not have a real world equivalent and thus are not available when working with a real robot.\nA good practice if you want to write code compatible for both cases is to use the simulated property. It is automatically set to the correct value depending on how your instantiate your robot. For instance,\npoppy = PoppyHumanoid(simulator='vrep')\n\ndef reset_position():\n    if poppy.simulated:\n        poppy.reset_simulation()\n    else:\n        print('Ask one internship student to put the robot back in its origin position.')\n        time.sleep(10)\n\nVersion and 3rd party libraries\nThe main drawback of this client/server way of working is that your locally installed software versions may differ from the one installed on the robot.\nThe Python installed on the robot is Python 3 and comes with most of the scientific main libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, opencv). An exhaustive list of the installed Python packages will be available soon . At the moment, the easier way to get it is to used a terminal notebook which can be directly run from the Jupyter interface.\n\n\nUsing the same technique, you can install 3rd party libraries directly on the robot. The pip utility is installed in a virtual environment and should be used when possible.\nNote that the embedded board are based on armv7 and thus some libraries may be hard to compile. We are maintaining a list of conda recipes specifically built for this platform here.Contributions are more than welcomed! \nQuestions ?\nWe're always happy to help with code or other questions you might have!

It provides shortcuts to start services like SnapRemoteServer and HTTPRemoteServer from your terminal.\nExample:\n    poppy-services poppy-ergo-jr --snap --no-browser\nThis will launch the SnapRemoteServer for a real Poppy Ergo Jr robot.\n\nNote The --no-browser option avoid the automatic redirection to the Snap! webpage.\nYou can remove it if you use a computer with a GUI (e.g your laptop instead of the robot embedded board).\n\nAnother example:\n    poppy-services poppy-ergo-jr --snap --poppy-simu\nIt will open a Snap! windows for a simulated poppy-ergo-jr.\nThe way to use it is:\npoppy-services  \nthe available options are:\n\n--vrep: creates the specified creature for using with CoppeliaSim simulator\n--poppy-simu: creates the specified creature for using with web simulator and also launches the HTTP server needed by poppy-simu. Poppy-simu is only available for poppy-erg-jr for now.\n--snap: launches the Snap! server and directly imports the specific Poppy blocks.\n-nb or --no-browser: avoid automatic start of Snap! in web\nbrowser, use only with --snap\n--http: start a http robot server\n--remote: start a remote robot server\n-v or --verbose: start services in verbose mode (more logs)\n\nCreate your own Poppy creature\nWhile developping a new Poppy creature, it is first easier to simply define it in a configuration file or dictionnary and instanciate a pypot.robot.robot.Robot from Pypot directly.\nBut when you want to make it easily usable and available to non-geek public, the best is to create your own creature's library. It should contain a configuration file and a class that extends pypot.creatures.abstractcreature.AbstractPoppyCreature. You can then\nadd your own properties and primitives.\nExample from Poppy Humanoid:\nclass PoppyHumanoid(AbstractPoppyCreature):\n    @classmethod\n    def setup(cls, robot):\n        robot._primitive_manager._filter = partial(numpy.sum, axis=0)\n\n        for m in robot.motors:\n            m.goto_behavior = 'minjerk'\n\n        for m in robot.torso:\n            m.compliant_behavior = 'safe'\n\n        # Attach default primitives:\n        # basic primitives:\n        robot.attach_primitive(StandPosition(robot), 'stand_position')\n        robot.attach_primitive(SitPosition(robot), 'sit_position')\n\n        # Safe primitives:\n        robot.attach_primitive(LimitTorque(robot), 'limit_torque')\n\nPackage your code it properly using setuptools.\nFor a better integration with the Poppy installer scripts, please have in the root of your repo a folder named software containing:\n\nthe installation files (setup.py, MANIFEST, LICENCE)\na folder named poppy_yourcreaturename containing your actual code\n\nAt the end, don't forget to share it to the community!

Be careful, this IP address may vary each time, but poppy.local does not, unless you change the robot name in the settings.\nIf the ping is successul, jump to II.A. If it is not, an error is probably displayed instead, telling that the tentative of communication has failed, in that case jump to II.B..\nOn Windows, a ping test aborts after 4 lines. On GNU/Linux and OSX, new lines appear every second infinitely. You can press Ctrl + C to stop it, or just close the terminal as a regular window.\nII.A. If the ping test succeeds\nIf the ping test succeeds but you still cannot http://poppy.local, the problem probably comes from the web browser.\n\nMake sure you do not omit the http:// prefix. This prefix ensure that a normal connection to the robot is made. Modern web browsers may be tempted to make a secure connection instead by replacing it by https://, but secure connections only work when surfing the Internet.\nYou may experience cache troubles: press Ctrl+Shift+R to tell your browser to reload the page without caching.\nTry another web browser: Mozilla Firefox, Chromium, Safari, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome...\nIn last resorts, it is possible that Poppy software fail to start on the Raspberry Pi. In that case it is recommanded to re-flash your SD card.\n\nII.B. If the ping test fails\nIf the ping test succeeds you experience a network issue: your computer does not manage to talk to Poppy!\n\nUnplug the power supply of the robot, it will shut down\nPlug it again, bby paying a particular attention to the red and green LEDs of the Raspberry Pi:\n\nThe red LED PWR (Power) must be steady red 🔴 and the green led ACT (activity) must irregularly flicker during about 45 seconds, meaning that the robot is booting. Choose your case A, B, C, or D:\nA. If PWR is not steady red 🔴 : you experience a power failure. With an Ergo Jr robot, you might have plugged your Pixl board incorrectly, make your sure followed the electronic assembly procedure correctively. Otherwise, your Pixl board or you power supply, or your Raspberry Pi may be faulty. Try swapping components from another robots to identify the faulty component if you have several robots, or contact your robot supplier.\nB. If the green led ACT remains off, then the system on the SD card is probably faulty, or the SD card itself, or the Raspberry Pi. First try to re-flash your SD card, then try to flash and use another SD card >8GB, and in last resort try with another Raspberry Pi.\nC. If the green led ACT 🟢 flashes regularly as a sequence of long and short flashes, the blinking sequence can give you clues about the reason of boot failure. Consult the appropriate documentation. \nD. If the green led ACT 🟢 flashes irregularly during about 45 seconds and then almost switch off except ponctual flashing, and if the ping still fails, it means that the robot is booting properly but some network error is happening. The connection mode you have chosen (wifi, direct Ethernet, Ethernet through a router, or hostpot) might be not working with your configuration. A good idea in that case is to fall back to the simplest possible connection: Ethernet through a router, which requires 2 Ethernet cables: 1 from your robot to your router and 1 from your computer to your router. And execute again the diagnostic procedure.\nProblem 2: My robot makes shaky motions\nThis may be due to old cables. Especially if you feel that cables are rigid compared to brand new cables, while they should be flexible. Old cable may cause communication issues. Change them with brand new cables.\nProblem 3: My robot makes weird motions or auto-collides\nIf you robot makes motions that are not those that you expect or even collides with itself, it is probably because you assembled the robot the wrong way. Open the assembly guide again, and observe carefully that every part of your assembly matches the pictures. It is very easy to build a robot that looks properly assembled but that is not.\nProblem 4 : What is the default SSH password of my robot?\nA password is needed only for SSH access (advanced users). With the regular Poppy image, the username is poppy and the password is poppy. With the ROS image, the username is  pi and the password is raspberry.\nQuestions ?\nWe're always happy to help with code or other questions you might have!
